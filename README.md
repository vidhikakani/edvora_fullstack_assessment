Edvora Fullstack Assessment

Fullstack application based on the Pokemon API (pokeapi.co) that has the following features:

1. Login/Signup
2. Storing the userâ€™s favorite pokemon in a database and retrieving it with an authenticated API call

We require you to create the assessment using FastAPI and React.js. 
We would also like you to not use tools such as Firebase/Hasura to simplify the development.
